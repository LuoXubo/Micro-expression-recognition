# Mirco-expression-recognition

## Introduction

This project is a part of the course project of the course "Emotional Computing" in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. The project is to recognize the micro-expression of people. The project is based on the CASME III, made by the Insitute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

## Dataset

Here is a brief introduction of the dataset:

- 216 subjects were recruited, and each subject provided about 8 hours of video data, which contains more than 8,000,000 frames.
- 1030 micro-expressions and 3364 macro-expressions were manually annotated.
- Depth information was provided as an additional modality.
- More than 13000 seconds of physiological and speech signals were collected.
- 1508 unannotated videos were provided, which contains more than 4,000,000 frames.
- The dataset was designed to simulate real-world scenarios, and the subjects were induced to show micro-expressions by simulating criminal scenarios.

## Method

We use the following methods to recognize the micro-expression:
